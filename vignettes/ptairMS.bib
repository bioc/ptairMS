This novel type of small molecule analysis can be performed not only on conventional biological samples such as plasma or urine but also on sputum, bronchoalveolar fluid, exhaled breath condensate or exhaled breath itself (which is particularly relevant for research on respiratory diseases). On one hand, powerful analytical methodologies (including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) are labour-intensive but enable the exhaustive identification of metabolites. On the other hand, electronic noses can be used for exhaled breath analysis. Although the latter devices do not contain metabolite-specific sensors, they produce a condition- or treatment-specific “breathprint” based on pattern recognition. Breath analysis with electronic noses is noninvasive, and can be performed at the bedside in real time. Here, we review the literature on metabolomics studies in respiratory medicine, with a focus on the evaluation of responses to pharmacotherapy.},

	abstract = {A compendium of all the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emanating from the human body (the volatolome) is for the ﬁrst time reported. 1840 VOCs have been assigned from breath (872), saliva (359), blood (154), milk (256), skin secretions (532) urine (279), and faeces (381) in apparently healthy individuals. Compounds were assigned CAS registry numbers and named according to a common convention where possible. The compounds have been grouped into tables according to their chemical class or functionality to permit easy comparison. Some clear differences are observed, for instance, a lack of esters in urine with a high number in faeces. Careful use of the database is needed. The numbers may not be a true reﬂection of the actual VOCs present from each bodily excretion. The lack of a compound could be due to the techniques used or reﬂect the intensity of effort e.g. there are few publications on VOCs from blood compared to a large number on VOCs in breath. The large number of volatiles reported from skin is partly due to the methodologies used, e.g. collecting excretions on glass beads and then heating to desorb VOCs. All compounds have been included as reported (unless there was a clear discrepancy between name and chemical structure), but there may be some mistaken assignations arising from the original publications, particularly for isomers. It is the authors’ intention that this database will not only be a useful database of VOCs listed in the literature, but will stimulate further study of VOCs from healthy individuals. Establishing a list of volatiles emanating from healthy individuals and increased understanding of VOC metabolic pathways is an important step for differentiating between diseases using VOCs.},

	abstract = {The High Resolution Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (HR PTR-TOF-MS) is a powerful analytical tool used by various scientiﬁc communities for real-time measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOC). The analysis of HR PTR-TOF-MS data is, however, particularly demanding because of the large amount of complex data being generated. Based on recently developed or described mathematical methods, we have produced a new software tool, the PTR-TOF Data Analyzer, which greatly facilitates the data analysis process. The new software solution allows for i) a combined Poisson counting statistics and dead time correction of ion count rates, ii) accurate mass axis calibration, iii) an iterative residual peak analysis that detects up to 5 isobaric peaks per unit m/z, iv) time series analysis of both low and high mass and time resolution data and v) visualization of analysis results for fast quality assurance checks. After having been successfully tested by a group of users with different application needs, the PTR-TOF Data Analyzer is made generally available to the scientiﬁc community. This will improve the user-friendliness of the PTR-TOF-MS technique and facilitate scientiﬁc work with this new analytical mass spectrometer.},

            Breathomics is a special branch of metabolomics that quantifies volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from collected exhaled breath samples. Understanding how breath molecules are related to diseases, mechanisms and pathways identified from experimental analytical measurements is challenging due to the lack of an organized resource describing breath molecules, related references and biomedical information embedded in the literature. To provide breath VOCs, related references and biomedical information, we aim to organize a database composed of manually curated information and automatically extracted biomedical information. First, VOCs-related disease information was manually organized from 207 literature linked to 99 VOCs and known Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms. Then an automated text mining algorithm was used to extract biomedical information from this literature. In the end, the manually curated information and auto-extracted biomedical information was combined to form a breath molecule database—the Human Breathomics Database (HBDB). We first manually curated and organized disease information including MeSH term from 207 literatures associated with 99 VOCs. Then, an automatic pipeline of text mining approach was used to collect 2766 literatures and extract biomedical information from breath researches. We combined curated information with automatically extracted biomedical information to assemble a breath molecule database, the HBDB. The HBDB is a database that includes references, VOCs and diseases associated with human breathomics. Most of these VOCs were detected in human breath samples or exhaled breath condensate samples. So far, the database contains a total of 913 VOCs in relation to human exhaled breath researches reported in 2766 publications. The HBDB is the most comprehensive HBDB of VOCs in human exhaled breath to date. It is a useful and organized resource for researchers and clinicians to identify and further investigate potential biomarkers from the breath of patients.
