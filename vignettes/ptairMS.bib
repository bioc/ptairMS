	abstract = {DNA micro-arrays now permit scientists to screen thousands of genes simultaneously and determine whether those genes are active, hyperactive or silent in normal or cancerous tissue. Because these new micro-array devices generate bewildering amounts of raw data, new analytical methods must be developed to sort out whether cancer tissues have distinctive signatures of gene expression over normal tissues or other types of cancer tissues. In this paper, we address the problem of selection of a small subset of genes from broad patterns of gene expression data, recorded on DNA micro-arrays. Using available training examples from cancer and normal patients, we build a classiﬁer suitable for genetic diagnosis, as well as drug discovery. Previous attempts to address this problem select genes with correlation techniques. We propose a new method of gene selection utilizing Support Vector Machine methods based on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE). We demonstrate experimentally that the genes selected by our techniques yield better classiﬁcation performance and are biologically relevant to cancer.},

In particular, we apply all selection methods to the discrimination of nine varieties of strawberries and six varieties of typical cheeses from Trentino Province, North Italy. Using replicated experiments we estimate unbiased generalization errors. Our results show that RF-RFE outperforms SVM-RFE and KWS on the task of finding small subsets of features with high discrimination levels on PTR-MS data sets.

In comparison with standard techniques such as GC-MS, PTR-TOF-MS has the remarkable advantage of being extremely fast but has the drawback that compound identiﬁcation is more challenging and often not possible without further information. In order to better exploit and understand the analytical information entangled in the PTR-TOF-MS ﬁngerprint and to link it with SPME/GC-MS analyses we employed two multivariate calibration methods, PLS and the more recent LASSO. We show that, while in some cases it is sufﬁcient to consider a single PTR-TOF-MS peak in order to predict the intensity of a SPME/GC-MS peak, in general a multivariate approach is needed. We compare the performances of PLS and LASSO in terms of prediction capabilities and interpretability of the model coefﬁcients and conclude that LASSO is more suitable for this problem. As case study, we compared GC and PTR-MS data for different matrices, namely olive oil and grana cheese.},

Commercially available set-ups are usually based on quadrupole analysers that, due to the unit mass resolution, do not provide useful analytical information besides the nominal mass of the ions detected. Recently new instruments based on time-of-ﬂight (PTR-TOF-MS) analysers have been proposed and commercialized. They provide higher mass resolution and thus improve the analytical information contained in the spectra. Mass accuracy, however, is an issue that has not been considered in great detail in the published papers on PTR-TOF-MS so far. We show here that the mass accuracy obtained by a commercial apparatus can be improved by proper data analysis. In particular, internal calibration based on an improved algorithm allows for a mass accuracy that sufﬁces for elemental determination in the most common situations. Achieving good mass accuracy is a fundamental step for further exploiting the analytical potential of PTR-MS.},

This opens new horizons for research and allows for new applications in ﬁelds where the rapid and sensitive monitoring and quantiﬁcation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is crucial as, for instance, environmental sciences, food sciences and medicine. In particular, if coupled with appropriate data mining methods, it can provide a fast MS-nose system with rich analytical information. The main, perhaps even the only, drawback of this new technique in comparison to its precursor is related to the increased size and complexity of the data sets obtained. It appears that this is the main limitation to its full use and widespread application. Here we present and discuss a complete computer-based strategy for the data analysis of PTR-TOF-MS data from basic mass spectra handling, to the application of up-to date data mining methods. As a case study we apply the whole procedure to the classiﬁcation of apple cultivars and clones, which was based on the distinctive proﬁles of volatile organic compound emissions.},

The most common approach to analyze data gained from counting systems is to ﬁt the data peak by peak using an appropriate probability density function (PDF) like a Gaussian function. Since a counting system creates histograms, the counted data do not represent data points of the anticipated PDF. Therefore, one should not ﬁt any PDF directly to the histogram data. Here we present a solution to this problem by ﬁtting distributions instead of densities. A simple formula allows to correct for Poisson statistics and dead-time effects.

A smog chamber example is presented to demonstrate the performance and constraints for real data, with an example focusing on m/z 43. In this case, two isobaric peaks can be separated (m/z 43.015 and m/z 43.043) and identiﬁed as C2H3O+ and C2H5N+ respectively. Indistinguishable isobaric interferences slightly shift the exact m/z ratios resulting in a worse mass accuracy as expected from the simulations. Nevertheless, a 50 ppm mass accuracy is achieved, which is an impressive value for the identiﬁcation of two isobaric peaks separated by 0.65 full width half maximum for an instrument with a mass resolving power of only R = 1000. According to the simulations, a mass resolving power of at least 4000 would be necessary to quantitatively separate the expected isobaric interferences that are separated by a m/z difference of about 0.004 at m/z 43.},

Ion signals in the upper m/z range did not increase linearly with analyte concentration (0–150 ppbv) when the MCP detector was not operated in the saturation regime. Both effects may lead to large errors in VOC quantiﬁcation by PTR-ToF-MS if the instrument is not externally calibrated on a frequent basis. We also demonstrate that the current practice of minimizing ion feedback in the MCP detector will trigger the described problems.

	abstract = {Background: Thanks to a reasonable cost and simple sample preparation procedure, linear MALDI-ToF spectrometry is a growing technology for clinical microbiology. With appropriate spectrum databases, this technology can be used for early identification of pathogens in body fluids. However, due to the low resolution of linear MALDI-ToF instruments, robust and accurate peak picking remains a challenging task. In this context we propose a new peak extraction algorithm from raw spectrum. With this method the spectrum baseline and spectrum peaks are processed jointly. The approach relies on an additive model constituted by a smooth baseline part plus a sparse peak list convolved with a known peak shape. The model is then fitted under a Gaussian noise model. The proposed method is well suited to process low resolution spectra with important baseline and unresolved peaks.
Results: We developed a new peak deconvolution procedure. The paper describes the method derivation and discusses some of its interpretations. The algorithm is then described in a pseudo-code form where the required optimization procedure is detailed. For synthetic data the method is compared to a more conventional approach. The new method reduces artifacts caused by the usual two-steps procedure, baseline removal then peak extraction. Finally some results on real linear MALDI-ToF spectra are provided.
Conclusions: We introduced a new method for peak picking, where peak deconvolution and baseline computation are performed jointly. On simulated data we showed that this global approach performs better than a classical one where baseline and peaks are processed sequentially. A dedicated experiment has been conducted on real spectra. In this study a collection of spectra of spiked proteins were acquired and then analyzed. Better performances of the proposed method, in term of accuracy and reproductibility, have been observed and validated by an extended statistical analysis.},

The method is based on reactions of HsO+ ions, which perform non-dissociative proton transfer to most of the common organic trace constituents but do not react with any of the components present in clean air. Examples of analysis of breath taken from smokers and non-smokers as well as from patients suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, and of air in buildings as well as of ambient air taken at a road crossing demonstrate the wide range of applicability of this method. An enhanced level of acetonitrile in the breath is a most suitable indicator that a person is a smoker. Enhanced levels of propanol strongly indicate that a person has a severe liver deficiency.},

The most common approach to analyze data gained from counting systems is to ﬁt the data peak by peak using an appropriate probability density function (PDF) like a Gaussian function. Since a counting system creates histograms, the counted data do not represent data points of the anticipated PDF. Therefore, one should not ﬁt any PDF directly to the histogram data. Here we present a solution to this problem by ﬁtting distributions instead of densities. A simple formula allows to correct for Poisson statistics and dead-time effects. The improved peak analysis method is applied to mass spectra obtained from a recently developed proton-transfer-reaction time-ofﬂight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF) enhancing the mass accuracy and peak quantiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {We present a novel method for real-time breath-gas analysis using mass-spectrometric techniques: buffered end-tidal (BET) on-line sampling. BET has several advantages over conventional direct on-line sampling where the subject inhales and exhales through a sampling tube. In our approach, a single exhalation is administered through a tailored tube in which the end-tidal fraction of the breath-gas sample is buffered. This increases sampling time by an order of magnitude to several seconds, improving signal quality and reducing the total measurement time per test subject. Furthermore, only one exhalation per minute is required for sampling and the test subject can otherwise maintain a normal breathing pattern, thereby reducing the risk of hyperventilation. To validate our new BET sampling method we conducted comparative measurements with direct on-line sampling using proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry. We ﬁnd excellent agreement in measured acetone and acetonitrile concentrations. High variability observed in breath-by-breath isoprene concentrations is attributed to differences in exhalation depth and inﬂuences of hyperventilation on end-tidal concentrations.},

Recently, there has been significant progress in the development of various peak detection algorithms. However, neither a comprehensive survey nor an experimental comparison of these algorithms is yet available. The main objective of this paper is to provide such a survey and to compare the performance of single spectrum based peak detection methods.
Results: In general, we can decompose a peak detection procedure into three consequent parts: smoothing, baseline correction and peak finding. We first categorize existing peak detection algorithms according to the techniques used in different phases. Such a categorization reveals the differences and similarities among existing peak detection algorithms. Then, we choose five typical peak detection algorithms to conduct a comprehensive experimental study using both simulation data and real MALDI MS data.
Conclusion: The results of comparison show that the continuous wavelet-based algorithm provides the best average performance.},

We hypothesized that one of these markers, namely propionaldehyde, will be increased in lung and heart–lung transplant patients where severe oxidative stress due to I/R injury with early graft dysfunction represents one of the major postoperative complications resulting in prolonged ventilation and increased in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Expiratory air measurements for acetone, isoprene, and propionaldehyde were performed in seven patients after lung (n ¼5) or heart–lung (n ¼2) transplantation, ventilated patients (n ¼ 12), and healthy volunteers (n ¼17) using online ion-molecule reaction mass spectrometry.

	abstract = {Introduction: The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) serve as the accepted standard to monitor treatment efﬁcacy in lung cancer. However, the time intervals between consecutive computerized tomography scans might be too long to allow early identiﬁcation of treatment failure. This study examines the use of breath sampling to monitor responses to anticancer treatments in patients with advanced lung cancer.
Methods: A total of 143 breath samples were collected from 39 patients with advanced lung cancer. The exhaled breath signature, determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and a nanomaterial-based array of sensors, was correlated with the response to therapy assessed by RECIST: complete response, partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease.
Results: Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis identiﬁed three volatile organic compounds as signiﬁcantly indicating disease control (PR/stable disease), with one of them also signiﬁcantly discriminating PR/stable disease from progressive disease. The nanoarray had the ability to monitor changes in tumor response across therapy, also indicating any lack of further response to therapy. When one-sensor analysis was used, 59\% of the follow-up samples were identiﬁed correctly. There was 85\% success in monitoring disease control (stable disease/partial response).
Conclusion: Breath analysis, using mainly the nanoarray, may serve as a surrogate marker for the response to systemic therapy in lung cancer. As a monitoring tool, it can provide the oncologist with a quick bedside method of identifying a lack of response to an anticancer treatment. This may allow quicker recognition than does the current RECIST analysis. Early recognition of treatment failure},

Early diagnosis is limited by the fact that the disease usually develops asymptomatically and available screening methods do not fulfil the requirements for reliable discrimination between patients with lung cancer and subjects not suffering from the disease. Breath sampling is completely noninvasive and provides a potentially useful approach to screening lung cancer. Exhaled biomarkers contain both volatile and nonvolatile molecules. The profile of volatile organic compounds is different in patients with lung cancer than in control subjects. In exhaled breath condensate, the proteomic profile of breath from cancer patients differs from that of healthy smokers. We reviewed the scientific evidence demonstrating that a unique chemical signature can be detected in the breath of patients with lung cancer and that the exhaled breath biomarker profile could aid clinical decision making.},

On one hand, powerful analytical methodologies (including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) are labour-intensive but enable the exhaustive identification of metabolites. On the other hand, electronic noses can be used for exhaled breath analysis. Although the latter devices do not contain metabolite-specific sensors, they produce a condition- or treatment-specific “breathprint” based on pattern recognition.

	abstract = {Breath analysis has attracted a considerable amount of scientific and clinical interest during the last decade. In contrast to NO, which is predominantly generated in the bronchial system, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are mainly blood borne and therefore enable monitoring of different processes in the body. Exhaled ethane and pentane concentrations were elevated in inflammatory diseases. Acetone was linked to dextrose metabolism and lipolysis. Exhaled isoprene concentrations showed correlations with cholesterol biosynthesis. Exhaled levels of sulphur-containing compounds were elevated in liver failure and allograft rejection. Looking at a set of volatile markers may enable recognition and diagnosis of complex diseases such as lung or breast cancer. Due to technical problems of sampling and analysis and a lack of normalization and standardization, huge variations exist between results of different studies. This is among the main reasons why breath analysis could not yet been introduced into clinical practice. This review addresses the basic principles of breath analysis and the diagnostic potential of different volatile breath markers. Analytical procedures, issues concerning biochemistry and exhalation mechanisms of volatile substances, and future developments will be discussed.},

Compounds were assigned CAS registry numbers and named according to a common convention where possible. The compounds have been grouped into tables according to their chemical class or functionality to permit easy comparison. Some clear differences are observed, for instance, a lack of esters in urine with a high number in faeces. Careful use of the database is needed. The numbers may not be a true reﬂection of the actual VOCs present from each bodily excretion. The lack of a compound could be due to the techniques used or reﬂect the intensity of effort e.g. there are few publications on VOCs from blood compared to a large number on VOCs in breath. The large number of volatiles reported from skin is partly due to the methodologies used, e.g. collecting excretions on glass beads and then heating to desorb VOCs. All compounds have been included as reported (unless there was a clear discrepancy between name and chemical structure), but there may be some mistaken assignations arising from the original publications, particularly for isomers. It is the authors’ intention that this database will not only be a useful database of VOCs listed in the literature, but will stimulate further study of VOCs from healthy individuals. Establishing a list of volatiles emanating from healthy individuals and increased understanding of VOC metabolic pathways is an important step for differentiating between diseases using VOCs.},

The objective of this manuscript is to systematically review the current knowledge on exhaled VOCs with respect to their potential clinical use in asthma, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis (CF), and respiratory tract infections. A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane database, and reference lists of retrieved studies. Controlled, clinical, English-language studies exploring the diagnostic and monitoring value of VOCs in asthma, COPD, CF, lung cancer and respiratory tract infections were included. Data on study design, setting, participant characteristics, VOCs techniques, and outcome measures were extracted. Seventy-three studies were included, counting in total 3,952 patients and 2,973 healthy controls. The collection and analysis of exhaled VOCs is non-invasive and could be easily applied in the broad range of patients, including subjects with severe disease and children. Various research groups demonstrated that VOCs profiles could accurately distinguish patients with a pulmonary disease from healthy controls. Pulmonary diseases seem to be characterized by a disease specific breath-print, as distinct profiles were found in patients with dissimilar diseases. The heterogeneity of studies challenged the inter-laboratory comparability. In conclusion, profiles of VOCs are potentially able to accurately diagnose various pulmonary diseases. Despite these promising findings, multiple challenges such as further standardization and validation of the diverse techniques need to be mastered before VOCs can be applied into clinical practice.},

	abstract = {Background: Determination of the diagnostic usefulness of proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) for detecting primary lung cancer through analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled human breath was demonstrated in this investigation. Unlike, for example, gas-chromatographic analyses, PTR-MS can be used without time-consuming preconcentration of the gas samples.
Methods: By means of PTR-MS, exhaled breath samples from primary lung cancer patients (n = 17) were analyzed and compared with both an overall control collective (controls total, n = 170) and three sub-collectives: hospital personnel (controls hospital, n = 35), age-matched persons (controls age, n = 25), and smokers (controls s, n = 60), respectively.
Results: Among the VOCs present at reasonably high concentrations, the ones leading to the product ion at m/z = 31 (VOC-31, tentatively protonated formaldehyde) and m/z = 43 (VOC-43, tentatively a fragment of protonated iso-propanol), were found at signiﬁcantly higher concentrations in the breath gas of the primary lung cancer patients as compared to the healthy controls at the following median concentrations (with interquartile distance, iqr): For VOC-31 the median concentrations were 7.0 ppb (iqr, 15.5 ppb) versus 3.0 ppb (iqr, 1.9 ppb) with P {\textless} 10−4. For VOC-43 the median concentrations were 244.1 ppb (iqr, 236.2 ppb) versus 94.1 ppb (iqr, 55.2 ppb) with P {\textless} 10−6. The discriminative power between the two collectives was further assessed by ROC-curves obtained upon variation of the chosen threshold concentration and by Fisher’s Quadratic Discriminant Method.
Conclusions: Within the limits of pilot study, VOC-31 and -43 were found to best discriminate between exhaled breath of primary lung cancer cases and healthy controls. Simple and time-saving breath gas analysis by PTR-MS makes this method attractive for a larger clinical evaluation. It may become a new valuable tool for diagnosing primary lung cancer.},

	abstract = {Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema risk groups are well deﬁned and screening allows for early identiﬁcation of disease. The capability of exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to detect emphysema, as found by computed tomography (CT) in current and former heavy smokers participating in a lung cancer screening trial, was investigated. CT scans, pulmonary function tests and breath sample collections were obtained from 204 subjects. Breath samples were analyzed with a proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) to obtain VOC proﬁles listed as ions at various mass-to-charge ratios (m/z). Using bootstrapped stepwise forward logistic regression, we identiﬁed speciﬁc breath proﬁles as a potential tool for the diagnosis of emphysema, of airﬂow limitation or gas-exchange impairment. A marker for emphysema was found at m/z 87 (tentatively attributed to 2-methylbutanal). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of this marker to diagnose emphysema was 0.588 (95\% CI 0.453–0.662). Mass-to-charge ratios m/z 52 (most likely chloramine) and m/z 135 (alkyl benzene) were linked to obstructive disease and m/z 122 (most probably alkyl homologs) to an impaired diffusion capacity. ROC areas were 0.646 (95\% CI 0.562–0.730) and 0.671 (95\% CI 0.524–0.710), respectively. In the screening setting, exhaled VOCs measured by PTR-MS constitute weak markers for emphysema, pulmonary obstruction and impaired diffusion capacity.},

The collection method and data analysis is validated for its accuracy, precision, selectivity, limits of detection, sensitivity and reproducibility. Consecutive ﬁllings of ﬁve bags by the same person gave reproducible results to within 12\% relative standard deviation (RSD) for methanol, acetaldehyde, acetone and water content from breath, whereas isoprene was constant to within 30\% RSD. In an exploratory small-scale case-control study, we monitor the exhaled breath of 11 lung cancer patients on the day before surgery. The control group consisted of 57 age-matched subjects, the so-called ‘healthy smokers’. This study is used as an example of the use of the system presented here.},

	abstract = {Background: Esophageal cancer is a prevalent malignancy. There is a considerable demand for developing a fast and noninvasive method to screen out the suspect esophageal cancer patients who may undergo further clinical diagnosis.
Methods: The exhaled breathes from 29 esophageal cancer patients and 57 healthy people were directly measured using our home-made proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS). Mann-Whitney U test and stepwise discriminant analysis were applied to identify the ions in the breath mass spectral data which can distinguish cancer cohort from healthy group. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was also performed.
Results: Seven kinds of ions in the breath mass spectrum, viz., m/z 136, m/z 34, m/z 63, m/z 27, m/z 95, m/z 107 and m/z 45, have been found to distinguish between the esophageal cancer patients and healthy people with a sensitivity of 86.2\% and a speciﬁcity of 89.5\%, respectively. Compared with that from the healthy people, the breath mass spectra from esophageal cancer patients show that the mediant intensities of ﬁve kinds of ions were decrease and the rest two kinds of ions were increase. ROC analysis gave the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.943.
Conclusions: This pilot study shows that the ionic characteristics of exhaled VOCs detected by PTR-MS may be used to differentiate between the esophageal cancer patients and the healthy people. Although the breath tests for more patients are needed to conﬁrm such results, the present work indicates that the PTR-MS may be a promising method in the esophageal cancer screening.},

Twenty-six volunteers have been enrolled in this study: 12 patients (M/F 8/4, mean age 70.5 years, min-max 42–80 years) with liver cirrhosis of different etiologies and at different severity of disease and 14 healthy subjects (M/F 5/9, mean age 52.3 years, min-max 35–77 years). Real time breath analysis was performed on fasting subjects using a buffered end-tidal on-line sampler directly coupled to a PTR-ToF-MS. Twelve volatile organic compounds (VOCs) resulted significantly differently in cirrhotic patients (CP) compared to healthy controls (CTRL): four ketones (2-butanone, 2- or 3- pentanone, C8-ketone, C9ketone), two terpenes (monoterpene, monoterpene related), four sulphur or nitrogen compounds (sulfoxide-compound, Scompound, NS-compound, N-compound) and two alcohols (heptadienol, methanol). Seven VOCs (2-butanone, C8-ketone, a monoterpene, 2,4-heptadienol and three compounds containing N, S or NS) resulted significantly differently in compensate cirrhotic patients (Child-Pugh A; CP-A) and decompensated cirrhotic subjects (Child-Pugh B+C; CP-B+C). ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) analysis was performed considering three contrast groups: CP vs CTRL, CP-A vs CTRL and CP-A vs CP-B+C. In these comparisons monoterpene and N-compound showed the best diagnostic performance.},

	abstract = {A proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) system has been developed which allows for on-line measurements of trace components with concentrations as low as a few pptv. The method is based on reactions of H 30 + ions, which perform non-dissociative proton transfer to most of the common volatile organic compounds (VOCs) but do not react with any of the components present in clean air. Medical applications by means of breath analysis allow for monitoring of metabolic processes in the human body, and examples of food research are discussed on the basis of VOC emissions from fruit, coffee and meat. Environmental applications include investigations of VOC emissions from decaying biomatter which have been found to be an important source for tropospheric acetone, methanol and ethanol. On-line monitoring of the diurnal variations of VOCs in the troposphere yield data demonstrating the present sensitivity of PTR-MS to be in the range of a few pptv. Finally, PTR-MS has proven to be an ideal tool to measure Henry's law constants and their dependencies on temperature as well as on the salt content of water. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

As breath sampling may be done in different body positions, effects of the sampling position on exhaled VOC concentrations were investigated by means of real-time mass spectrometry. Breaths from 15 healthy volunteers were analyzed in real-time by PTR-ToF-MS-8000 during paced breathing (12/min) in a continuous side-stream mode. We applied two series of body positions (setup 1: sitting, standing, supine, and sitting; setup 2: supine, left lateral, right lateral, prone, and supine). Each position was held for 2 min. Breath VOCs were quantiﬁed in inspired and alveolar air by means of a custom-made algorithm. Parallel monitoring of hemodynamics and capnometry was performed noninvasively. In setup 1, when compared to the initial sitting position, normalized mean concentrations of isoprene, furan, and acetonitrile decreased by 24\%, 26\%, and 9\%, respectively, during standing and increased by 63\%, 36\%, and 10\% during lying mirroring time proﬁles of stroke volume and pETCO2. In contrast, acetone and H2S concentrations remained almost constant. In setup 2, when compared to the initial supine position, mean alveolar concentrations of isoprene and furan increased signiﬁcantly up to 29\% and 16\%, respectively, when position was changed from lying on the right side to the prone position. As cardiac output and stroke volume decreased at that time, the reasons for the observed concentrations changes have to be linked to the ventilation/ perfusion ratio or compartmental distribution rather than to perfusion alone. During ﬁnal postures, all VOC concentrations, hemodynamics, and pET-CO2 returned to baseline. Exhaled blood-borne VOC proﬁles changed due to body postures. Changes depended on cardiac stroke volume, origin, compartmental distribution and physico-chemical properties of the substances. Patients’ positions and cardiac output have to be controlled when concentrations of breath VOCs are to be interpreted in terms of biomarkers.},

	abstract = {We deﬁne breathomics as the metabolomics study of exhaled air. It is a strongly emerging metabolomics research ﬁeld that mainly focuses on health-related volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Since the amount of these compounds varies with health status, breathomics holds great promise to deliver non-invasive diagnostic tools. Thus, the main aim of breathomics is to ﬁnd patterns of VOCs related to abnormal (for instance inﬂammatory) metabolic processes occurring in the human body. Recently, analytical methods for measuring VOCs in exhaled air with high resolution and high throughput have been extensively developed. Yet, the application of machine learning methods for ﬁngerprinting VOC proﬁles in the breathomics is still in its infancy. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the current state of the art in data pre-processing and multivariate analysis of breathomics data. We start with the detailed pre-processing pipelines for breathomics data obtained from gas-chromatography mass spectrometry and an ion-mobility spectrometer coupled to multi-capillary columns. The outcome of data pre-processing is a matrix containing the relative abundances of a set of VOCs for a group of patients under different conditions (e.g. disease stage, treatment). Independently of the utilized analytical method, the most important question, ‘which VOCs are discriminatory?’, remains the same. Answers can be given by several modern machine learning techniques (multivariate statistics) and, therefore, are the focus of this paper. We demonstrate the advantages as well the drawbacks of such techniques. We aim to help the community to understand how to proﬁt from a particular method. In parallel, we hope to make the community aware of the existing data fusion methods, as yet unresearched in breathomics.},

By modeling mass spectra as functions, this approach avoids reliance on peak detection methods. The ﬂexibility of this framework in modeling nonparametric ﬁxed and random eﬀect functions enables it to model the eﬀects of multiple factors simultaneously, allowing one to perform inference on multiple factors of interest using the same model ﬁt, while adjusting for clinical or experimental covariates that may aﬀect both the intensities and locations of peaks in the spectra. For example, this provides a straightforward way to account for systematic block and batch eﬀects that characterize these data. From the model output, we identify spectral regions that are diﬀerentially expressed across experimental conditions, in a way that takes both statistical and clinical signiﬁcance into account and controls the Bayesian false discovery rate to a prespeciﬁed level. We apply this method to two cancer studies.},

The 2-D CWT considered in this study is based on the formulation by Antoine et al. (2004). A concept of isosurface of 2-D wavelet coefﬁcients is proposed, and it is generated to indicate the location and approximate shape or area of the damage. The proposed algorithm is a response-based damage detection technique which only requires the mode shapes of the damaged plates. This algorithm is applied to the numerical vibration mode shapes of a cantilever plate with different types of damage to illustrate its effectiveness and viability. A comparative study with other two 2-D damage detection algorithms, i.e., 2-D gapped smoothing method (GSM) and 2-D strain energy method (SEM), is performed, and it demonstrates that the proposed 2-D CWT-based algorithm is superior in noise immunity and robust with limited sensor data. The algorithm is further implemented in an experimental modal test to detect impact damage in an FRP composite plate using smart piezoelectric actuators and sensors, demonstrating its applicability to the experimental mode shapes. The present 2-D CWT-based algorithm is among a few limited studies in the literature to explore the application of 2-D wavelets in damage detection, and as demonstrated in this study, it can be used as a viable and effective technique for damage identiﬁcation of plate- or shell-type structures.},

We show, in particular, how the reproducing kernel may be used for defining and evaluating the scale and angle-resolving power of a wavelet.

The method is based on reactions of H 30 + ions, which perform non-dissociative proton transfer to most of the common volatile organic compounds (VOCs) but do not react with any of the components present in clean air. Medical applications by means of breath analysis allow for monitoring of metabolic processes in the human body, and examples of food research are discussed on the basis of VOC emissions from fruit, coffee and meat. Environmental applications include investigations of VOC emissions from decaying biomatter which have been found to be an important source for tropospheric acetone, methanol and ethanol. On-line monitoring of the diurnal variations of VOCs in the troposphere yield data demonstrating the present sensitivity of PTR-MS to be in the range of a few pptv. Finally, PTR-MS has proven to be an ideal tool to measure Henry's law constants and their dependencies on temperature as well as on the salt content of water. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

This approach is very sensitive to the amount of smoothing and aggressiveness of the baseline correction, which contribute to making peak detection results inconsistent between runs, instrumentation and analysis methods.},

Based on recently developed or described mathematical methods, we have produced a new software tool, the PTR-TOF Data Analyzer, which greatly facilitates the data analysis process. The new software solution allows for i) a combined Poisson counting statistics and dead time correction of ion count rates, ii) accurate mass axis calibration, iii) an iterative residual peak analysis that detects up to 5 isobaric peaks per unit m/z, iv) time series analysis of both low and high mass and time resolution data and v) visualization of analysis results for fast quality assurance checks. After having been successfully tested by a group of users with different application needs, the PTR-TOF Data Analyzer is made generally available to the scientiﬁc community. This will improve the user-friendliness of the PTR-TOF-MS technique and facilitate scientiﬁc work with this new analytical mass spectrometer.},

This novel type of small molecule analysis can be performed not only on conventional biological samples such as plasma or urine but also on sputum, bronchoalveolar fluid, exhaled breath condensate or exhaled breath itself (which is particularly relevant for research on respiratory diseases). On one hand, powerful analytical methodologies (including mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy) are labour-intensive but enable the exhaustive identification of metabolites. On the other hand, electronic noses can be used for exhaled breath analysis. Although the latter devices do not contain metabolite-specific sensors, they produce a condition- or treatment-specific “breathprint” based on pattern recognition. Breath analysis with electronic noses is noninvasive, and can be performed at the bedside in real time. Here, we review the literature on metabolomics studies in respiratory medicine, with a focus on the evaluation of responses to pharmacotherapy.},

Compounds were assigned CAS registry numbers and named according to a common convention where possible. The compounds have been grouped into tables according to their chemical class or functionality to permit easy comparison. Some clear differences are observed, for instance, a lack of esters in urine with a high number in faeces. Careful use of the database is needed. The numbers may not be a true reﬂection of the actual VOCs present from each bodily excretion. The lack of a compound could be due to the techniques used or reﬂect the intensity of effort e.g. there are few publications on VOCs from blood compared to a large number on VOCs in breath. The large number of volatiles reported from skin is partly due to the methodologies used, e.g. collecting excretions on glass beads and then heating to desorb VOCs. All compounds have been included as reported (unless there was a clear discrepancy between name and chemical structure), but there may be some mistaken assignations arising from the original publications, particularly for isomers. It is the authors’ intention that this database will not only be a useful database of VOCs listed in the literature, but will stimulate further study of VOCs from healthy individuals. Establishing a list of volatiles emanating from healthy individuals and increased understanding of VOC metabolic pathways is an important step for differentiating between diseases using VOCs.},

Based on recently developed or described mathematical methods, we have produced a new software tool, the PTR-TOF Data Analyzer, which greatly facilitates the data analysis process. The new software solution allows for i) a combined Poisson counting statistics and dead time correction of ion count rates, ii) accurate mass axis calibration, iii) an iterative residual peak analysis that detects up to 5 isobaric peaks per unit m/z, iv) time series analysis of both low and high mass and time resolution data and v) visualization of analysis results for fast quality assurance checks. After having been successfully tested by a group of users with different application needs, the PTR-TOF Data Analyzer is made generally available to the scientiﬁc community. This will improve the user-friendliness of the PTR-TOF-MS technique and facilitate scientiﬁc work with this new analytical mass spectrometer.},

	abstract = {Abstract. During the CalNex study (15 May to 16 June 2010) a large suite of instruments was operated at the Los Angeles area ground supersite to characterize the sources and atmospheric processing of atmospheric pollution. The thermal-desorption proton-transfer-reaction mass-spectrometer (TD-PTR-MS) was deployed to an urban area for the first time and detected 691 organic ions in aerosol samples, the mean total concentration of which was estimated as 3.3 μg m−3. Based on comparison to total organic aerosol (OA) measurements, we estimate that approximately 50\% of the OA mass at this site was directly measured by the TD-PTR-MS. Based on correlations with aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) OA components, the ions were grouped to represent hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), local OA (LOA), semi-volatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA), and low volatility oxygenated OA (LV-OOA). Mass spectra and thermograms of the ion groups are mostly consistent with the assumed sources and/or photochemical origin of the OA components. The mass spectra of ions representing the primary components HOA and LOA included the highest m/z, consistent with their higher resistance to thermal decomposition, and they were volatilized at lower temperatures ({\textasciitilde} 150 °C). Photochemical ageing weakens C-C bond strengths (also resulting in chemical fragmentation), and produces species of lower volatility (through the addition of functional groups). Accordingly the mass spectra of ions representing the oxidized OA components (SV-OOA, and LV-OOA) lack the highest masses and they are volatilized at higher temperatures (250–300 °C). Chemical parameters like mean carbon number (nC), mean carbon oxidation state (OSC), and the atomic ratios O / C and H / C of the ion groups are consistent with the expected sources and photochemical processing of the aerosol components. Our data suggest that chemical fragmentation gains importance over functionalization as photochemical age of OA increases. Surprisingly, the photochemical age of OA decreases during the daytime hours, demonstrating the importance of rapid production of new (photochemically young) SV-OOA during daytime. The PTR detects higher organic N concentrations than the AMS, the reasons for which are not well understood and cannot be explained by known artifacts related to PTR or the AMS. The median atomic N / C ratio (6.4\%) of the ion group representing LV-OOA is a factor 2 higher than N / C of any other ion group. This suggests a multiphase chemical source involving ammonium ions is contributing to LV-OOA.},

	abstract = {Background: Truffles are symbiotic fungi that develop underground in association with plant roots, forming ectomycorrhizae. They are primarily known for the organoleptic qualities of their hypogeous fruiting bodies. Primarily, Tuber magnatum Pico is a greatly appreciated truffle species mainly distributed in Italy and Balkans. Its price and features are mostly depending on its geographical origin. However, the genetic variation within T. magnatum has been only partially investigated as well as its adaptation to several environments.
Results: Here, we applied an integrated omic strategy to T. magnatum fruiting bodies collected during several seasons from three different areas located in the North, Center and South of Italy, with the aim to distinguish them according to molecular and biochemical traits and to verify the impact of several environments on these properties. With the proteomic approach based on two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by mass spectrometry, we were able to identify proteins specifically linked to the sample origin. We further associated the proteomic results to an RNA-seq profiling, which confirmed the possibility to differentiate samples according to their source and provided a basis for the detailed analysis of genes involved in sulfur metabolism. Finally, geographical specificities were associated with the set of volatile compounds produced by the fruiting bodies, as quantitatively and qualitatively determined through proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) and gas-chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS). In particular, a partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) model built from the latter data was able to return high confidence predictions of sample source.
Conclusions: Results provide a characterization of white fruiting bodies by a wide range of different molecules, suggesting the role for specific compounds in the responses and adaptation to distinct environments.},

	abstract = {Background: Mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with online separation methods is commonly applied for differential and quantitative profiling of biological samples in metabolomic as well as proteomic research. Such approaches are used for systems biology, functional genomics, and biomarker discovery, among others. An ongoing challenge of these molecular profiling approaches, however, is the development of better data processing methods. Here we introduce a new generation of a popular open-source data processing toolbox, MZmine 2.
Results: A key concept of the MZmine 2 software design is the strict separation of core functionality and data processing modules, with emphasis on easy usability and support for high-resolution spectra processing. Data processing modules take advantage of embedded visualization tools, allowing for immediate previews of parameter settings. Newly introduced functionality includes the identification of peaks using online databases, MSn data support, improved isotope pattern support, scatter plot visualization, and a new method for peak list alignment based on the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. The performance of the RANSAC alignment was evaluated using synthetic datasets as well as actual experimental data, and the results were compared to those obtained using other alignment algorithms.
Conclusions: MZmine 2 is freely available under a GNU GPL license and can be obtained from the project website at: http://mzmine.sourceforge.net/. The current version of MZmine 2 is suitable for processing large batches of data and has been applied to both targeted and non-targeted metabolomic analyses.},

Proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) has been established as a new tool for a rapid determination of exhaled air proﬁle. However, no investigations have been carried out into the proﬁle of exhaled air as determined by PTR-MS. Therefore, it was the aim of the present study to determine the proﬁle of exhaled breath in a ﬁeld survey enrolling 344 persons. Analysis was performed using PTR-MS. No signiﬁcant correlations with age, blood pressure, and body mass index could be observed with any molecular mass. The present study delineates possible reference values for PTR-MS investigations into exhaled air proﬁle. In conclusion, the present study was the ﬁrst to delineate mass spectrometric characteristics of an average patient sample as possible reference values.},

	abstract = {Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath holds great promise for noninvasive diagnostic applications. However, concentrations of VOCs in breath may change quickly, and actual and previous uptakes of exogenous substances, especially in the clinical environment, represent crucial issues. We therefore adapted proton-transfer-reaction-time-of-ﬂight-mass spectrometry for real time breath analysis in the clinical environment. For reasons of medical safety, a 6 m long heated silcosteel transfer line connected to a sterile mouth piece was used for breath sampling from spontaneously breathing volunteers and mechanically ventilated patients. A time resolution of 200 ms was applied. Breath from mechanically ventilated patients was analyzed immediately after cardiac surgery. Breath from 32 members of staﬀ was analyzed in the post anesthetic care unit (PACU). In parallel, room air was measured continuously over 7 days. Detection limits for breath-resolved real time measurements were in the high pptV/low ppbV range. Assignment of signals to alveolar or inspiratory phases was done automatically by a matlab-based algorithm. Quickly and abruptly occurring changes of patients’ clinical status could be monitored in terms of breath-to-breath variations of VOC (e.g. isoprene) concentrations. In the PACU, room air concentrations mirrored occupancy. Exhaled concentrations of sevoﬂurane strongly depended on background concentrations in all participants. In combination with an optimized inlet system, the high time and mass resolution of PTR-ToF-MS provides optimal conditions to trace quick changes of breath VOC proﬁles and to assess eﬀects from the clinical environment.},

Based on exemplary data from an 11-week measurement campaign we show how detector aging led to an m/zdependent loss in detection efﬁciency in the m/z 33 (−19\%) to m/z 205 range (−67\%). Ion signals in the upper m/z range did not increase linearly with analyte concentration (0–150 ppbv) when the MCP detector was not operated in the saturation regime. Both effects may lead to large errors in VOC quantiﬁcation by PTR-ToF-MS if the instrument is not externally calibrated on a frequent basis. We also demonstrate that the current practice of minimizing ion feedback in the MCP detector will trigger the described problems. Our study may serve as a guide for diagnosing and optimizing PTR-ToF-MS detector performance.},

The method is demonstrated for a pair of Cr2+ isobars with a relative mass difference of 1.8 · 10−5, with either an additional, non-isobaric Cr+2 or a CrO+ ion appearing in the same time-of-ﬂight spectrum, although at a different number of revolutions during the same storage time. This is in contrast to earlier applications where ToF shift corrections are performed with ions at identical revolution numbers, typically isobars that are also acting as mass-reference ions. It is shown that ions of virtually any mass simultaneously stored in the MR-ToF analyzer can be employed. This is particularly useful in situations where both the ions of interest and the reference ions for mass calibration have only small count rates not sufﬁcient for the ToF-shift corrections. For the present system, the resolving power increases by more than a factor of two when the ofﬂine drift correction is applied.},

	abstract = {In this article, we propose an integrated model for oxygen transfer into the blood, coupled with a lumped mechanical model for the ventilation process. Objectives. We aim at investigating oxygen transfer into the blood at rest or exercise. The ﬁrst task consists in describing nonlinear eﬀects of the oxygen transfer under normal conditions. We also include the possible diﬀusion limitation in oxygen transfer observed in extreme regimes involving parameters such as alveolar and venous blood oxygen partial pressures, capillary volume, diﬀusing capacity of the membrane, oxygen binding by hemoglobin and transit time of the red blood cells in the capillaries. The second task consists in discussing the oxygen concentration heterogeneity along the path length in the acinus. Method. A lumped mechanical model is considered: a double-balloon model is built upon physiological properties such as resistance of the branches connecting alveoli to the outside air, and elastic properties of the surrounding medium. Then, we focus on oxygen transfer: while the classical [F.J. Roughton and R.E. Forster, J. Appl. Physiol. 11 (1957) 290–302]. approach accounts for the reaction rate with hemoglobin by means of an extra resistance between alveolar air and blood, we propose an alternate description. Under normal conditions, the Hill’s saturation curve simply quantiﬁes the net oxygen transfer during the time that venous blood stays in the close neighborhood of alveoli (transit time). Under degraded and/or exercise conditions (impaired alveolar-capillary membrane, reduced transit time, high altitude) diﬀusion limitation of oxygen transfer is accounted for by means of the nonlinear equation representing the evolution of oxygen partial pressure in the plasma during the transit time. Finally, a one-dimensional model is proposed to investigate the eﬀects of longitudinal heterogeneity of oxygen concentration in the respiratory tract during the ventilation cycle, including previous considerations on oxygen transfer. Results. This integrated approach allows us to recover the right orders of magnitudes in terms of oxygen transfer, at rest or exercise, by using well-documented data, without any parameter tuning or curve ﬁtting procedure. The diﬀusing capacity of the alveolar-capillary membrane does not aﬀect the oxygen transfer rate in the normal regime but, as it decreases (e.g. because of emphysema) below a critical value, it becomes a signiﬁcant parameter. The one-dimensional model allows to investigate the screening phenomenon, i.e. the possibility that oxygen transfer might be signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the fact that the exchange area in the peripheral acinus poorly participates to oxygen transfer at rest, thereby providing a natural reserve of transfer capacity for exercise condition. We do not recover this eﬀect: in particular we show that, at rest, although the oxygen concentration is slightly smaller in terminal alveoli, transfer mainly occurs in the acinar periphery.},

	abstract = {A computerized system has been developed to monitor tidal volume, respiration rate, mouth pressure, and carbon dioxide during breath collection. This system was used to investigate variability in the production of breath biomarkers over an 8-h period. Hyperventilation occurred when breath was collected from spontaneously breathing study subjects ( n = 8). Therefore, breath samples were collected from study subjects whose breathing were paced at a respiration rate of 10 breaths/min and whose tidal volumes were gauged according to body mass. In this “paced breathing” group ( n = 16), end-tidal concentrations of isoprene and ethane correlated with end-tidal carbon dioxide levels [Spearman's rank correlation test ( r
              s
              ) = 0.64, P = 0.008 and r
              s
              = 0.50, P = 0.05, respectively]. Ethane also correlated with heart rate ( r
              s
              = 0.52, P {\textless} 0.05). There was an inverse correlation between transcutaneous pulse oximetry and exhaled carbon monoxide ( r
              s
              = -0.64, P = 0.008). Significant differences were identified between men ( n = 8) and women ( n = 8) in the concentrations of carbon monoxide (4 parts per million in men vs. 3 parts per million in women; P = 0.01) and volatile sulfur-containing compounds (134 parts per billion in men vs. 95 parts per billion in women; P = 0.016). There was a peak in ethanol concentration directly after food consumption and a significant decrease in ethanol concentration 2 h later ( P = 0.01; n = 16). Sulfur-containing molecules increased linearly throughout the study period (β = 7.4, P {\textless} 0.003). Ventilation patterns strongly influence quantification of volatile analytes in exhaled breath and thus, accordingly, the breathing pattern should be controlled to ensure representative analyses.},

	abstract = {Breath analysis has attracted a considerable amount of scientific and clinical interest during the last decade. In contrast to NO, which is predominantly generated in the bronchial system, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are mainly blood borne and therefore enable monitoring of different processes in the body. Exhaled ethane and pentane concentrations were elevated in inflammatory diseases. Acetone was linked to dextrose metabolism and lipolysis. Exhaled isoprene concentrations showed correlations with cholesterol biosynthesis. Exhaled levels of sulphur-containing compounds were elevated in liver failure and allograft rejection. Looking at a set of volatile markers may enable recognition and diagnosis of complex diseases such as lung or breast cancer. Due to technical problems of sampling and analysis and a lack of normalization and standardization, huge variations exist between results of different studies. This is among the main reasons why breath analysis could not yet been introduced into clinical practice. This review addresses the basic principles of breath analysis and the diagnostic potential of different volatile breath markers. Analytical procedures, issues concerning biochemistry and exhalation mechanisms of volatile substances, and future developments will be discussed.},

Currently, a number of marker molecules have been identiﬁed in breath that could be used to identify disease, disease progression, or to monitor therapeutic intervention and this list is expected increase dramatically since the analysis of breath is ideally suited for population-based studies in the developed and underdeveloped world. Recent advances in analytical instrumentation have suggested that the use of exhaled breath in medicine should now be re-examined.

	abstract = {Discovering the volatile signature of cancer cells is an emerging approach in cancer research, as it may contribute to a fast and simple diagnosis of tumors in vivo and in vitro. One of the main contributors to such a volatile signature is hyperglycolysis, which characterizes the cancerous cell. The metabolic perturbation in cancer cells is known as the Warburg effect; glycolysis is preferred over oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), even in the presence of oxygen. The precise mitochondrial alterations that underlie the increased dependence of cancer cells on aerobic glycolysis for energy generation have remained a mystery. We aimed to proﬁle the volatile signature of the glycolysis activity in lung cancer cells. For that an in vitro model, using lung cancer cell line cultures (A549, H2030, H358, H322), was developed. The volatile signature was measured by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry under normal conditions and glycolysis inhibition. Glycolysis inhibition and mitochondrial activity were also assessed by mitochondrial respiration capacity measurements. Cells were divided into two groups upon their glycolytic proﬁle (PET positive and PET negative). Glycolysis blockade had a unique characteristic that was shared by all cells. Furthermore, each group had a characteristic volatile signature that enabled us to discriminate between those sub-groups of cells. In conclusion, lung cancer cells may have different subpopulations of cells upon low and high mitochondrial capacity. In both groups, glycolysis blockade induced a unique volatile signature.},

This phenomenon is used through the FDG-PET scans, and may affect the exhaled volatile signature. This study investigates the volatile signature in lung cancer (LC) before and after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to determine if tumor cells’ hyperglycolysis would affect the volatile signature. Blood glucose levels and exhaled breath samples were analyzed before the OGTT, and 90 min after, in both LC patients and controls. The volatile signature was measured by proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). Twenty-two LC patients (age 66.6  ±  12.7) with adenocarcinoma (n  =  14), squamous (n  =  6), small cell carcinoma (n  =  2), and twenty-one controls (age 54.4  ±  13.7; 10 non-smokers and 11 smokers) were included. All LC patients showed a hyperglycolytic state in their FDG-PET scans. Both baseline and post OGTT volatile signatures discriminate between the groups. The OGTT has a minimal effect in LC (a decrease in m/z 54 by 39\%, pv  =  0.0499); whereas in the control group, five masses (m/z 64, 87,88, 142 and 161) changed by  −13\%, −49\%, −40\% and  −29\% and 46\% respectively. To conclude, OGTT has a minimal effect on the VOC signature in LC patients, where a hyperglycolytic state already exists. In contrast, in the control group the OGTT has a profound effect in which induced hyperglycolysis significantly changed the VOC pattern. We hypothesized that a ceiling effect in cancerous patients is responsible for this discrepancy.},

In this paper the case is made for real-time breath analysis by obviating sample collection into bags or onto traps that can suffer from partial degradation of breath metabolites or the introduction of impurities. Real-time analysis of a broad range of volatile chemical compounds can be best achieved using SIFT-MS and PTR-MS, which are sufﬁciently sensitive and rapid to allow the simultaneous analyses of several trace gas metabolites in single breath exhalations. The basic principles and the ion chemistry that underpin these two analytical techniques are brieﬂy described and the differences between them, including their respective strengths and weaknesses, are revealed, especially with reference to the analysis of the complex matrix that is exhaled breath. A recent innovation is described that combines time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry with the proton transfer ﬂow-drift tube reactor, PTR-TOFMS, which provides greater resolution in the analytical mass spectrometer and allows separation of protonated isobaric molecules. Examples are presented of some recent data that well illustrate the quality and real-time feature of SIFT-MS and PTR-MS for the analysis of exhaled breath for physiological/biochemical/pharmacokinetics studies and for the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of biomarkers relating to speciﬁc disease states.},

Exhaled isoprene concentrations are reported to change under different clinical and physiological conditions, especially in response to enhanced cardiovascular and respiratory activity. Investigating isoprene exhalation kinetics under dynamical exercise helps to gather the relevant experimental information for understanding the gas exchange phenomena associated with this important VOC. The ﬁrst model for isoprene in exhaled breath has been developed by our research group. In this paper, we aim at giving a concise overview of this model and describe its role in providing supportive evidence for a peripheral (extrahepatic) source of isoprene.

	abstract = {Eucalyptol (1,8-cineole) is a common active agent in non-prescription pharmaceutical products that is employed to clear the airways during mucus blockages. Following ingestion of a eucalyptol-containing capsule, the capsule dissolves in the gut and transfers eucalyptol into the blood, which is subsequently expelled via the lungs, thus exposing this decongesting and inﬂammation-abating compound to the airways. The breath gas concentrations of eucalyptol in 11 healthy adult volunteers were monitored at regular intervals after capsule ingestion using on-line proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). Eucalyptol appeared in exhaled breath gas at varying times following ingestion, with its onset ranging from 1 h and 6 min to 4 h and 48 min (mean ± SD: 2.1 ± 0.5 h). Maximum concentrations also varied greatly, with peak eucalyptol levels between 106 and 1589 ppbv (mean ± SD: 489 ± 319 ppbv). These variations were not only inter-subject, but also intra-subject, i.e. repeated tests with the same participant yielded different onset times and a broad range of concentration maxima. A considerable contribution to these variations from infrequent sampling and analysis is discussed. This study characterized the temporal transfer of eucalyptol via the blood into the airways by examining exhaled breath and thereby demonstrated the suitability of on-line breath gas analyses, particularly PTR-MS, for certain pharmacokinetic investigations.},

Isotope labelling allowed distinguishing the emerging volatile metabolites from their naturally occurring, highly abundant counterparts in the human breath. Due to an extremely low detection limit of the employed technologies in the parts per trillion per volume range, it was possible to detect the emerging metabolic products in exhaled breath within ∼10 min after oral ingestion of isotope-labelled ethanol. We observed that ethanol was in part transformed into deuterated acetone and isoprene, reﬂecting the different fates of activated acetic acid (acetyl-coenzyme A), formed in ethanol metabolism. Using ethanol as a model clearly demonstrated the value of the here presented technique for the search for volatile markers for metabolic disorders in the exhaled breath and its potential usefulness in the diagnosis and monitoring of such diseases.},

	abstract = {Most—if not all—potential diagnostic applications in breath research involve different marker concentrations rather than unique breath markers which only occur in the diseased state. Hence, data interpretation is a crucial step in breath analysis. To avoid artiﬁcial signiﬁcance in breath testing every effort should be made to implement method validation, data cross-testing and statistical validation along this process. The most common data analysis related problems can be classiﬁed into three groups: confounding variables (CVs), which have a real correlation with both the diseased state and a breath marker but lead to the erroneous conclusion that disease and breath are in a causal relationship; voodoo correlations (VCs), which can be understood as statistically true correlations that arise coincidentally in the vast number of measured variables; and statistical misconceptions in the study design (SMSD). CV: Typical confounding variables are environmental and medical history, host factors such as gender, age, weight, etc and parameters that could affect the quality of breath data such as subject breathing mode, effects of breath sampling and effects of the analytical technique itself. VC: The number of measured variables quickly overwhelms the number of samples that can feasibly be taken. As a consequence, the chances of ﬁnding coincidental ‘voodoo’ correlations grow proportionally. VCs can typically be expected in the following scenarios: insufﬁcient number of patients, (too) many measurement variables, the use of advanced statistical data mining methods, and non-independent data for validation.},

	abstract = {Despite growing interest and considerable progress in breath research over the last decade, standardized practices for the sampling and analysis of breath gas volatiles remain elusive. The primary reasons for this are (a) the rich chemical diversity of exhaled breath that covers an extensive range of volatile organic compounds at highly varied concentrations, (b) the vast disparity in the analytical tools employed, (c) diverse study goals and (d) the presence of (unidentiﬁed) confounders. These aspects place stringent but divergent demands on sampling and analysis: each analytical tool, target compound and concentration range requires its own speciﬁc protocol and in many cases the latter two are not even known a priori. The ongoing rapid developments and constant discoveries in the ﬁeld of breath research and the lack of established best practices in breath gas sampling and analysis currently preclude an acceptable overall standardization of these methods. This paper addresses these manifold issues and suggests a framework that separately considers individual stages of sampling and analysis with a view to establishing standardization in the analysis of breath gas volatiles to suit different target compounds and analytical technologies.},

The breath sampler has low pressure drop ({\textless}0.5 kPa) and uses inert or disposable components to avoid bacteriological risk for the patients and contamination of the breath samples. A fully customisable software interface allows a real time control of the hardware and software status. The performances of the breath sampler were evaluated by comparing (a) the CO2 partial pressure calculated during the sampling with the CO2 pressure measured off-line within the Nalophan R bag; (b) the concentrations of four selected volatile organic compounds in dead space, end-tidal and mixed breath fractions.},

The effect of airway gas exchange on the interpretation of these exhaled breath measurements can be signiﬁcant. We describe airway gas exchange in relation to exhaled measurements of soluble gases that exchange in the alveoli. The mechanisms of airway gas exchange are reviewed and criteria for determining if a gas exchanges in the airways are provided. The effects of diffusion, perfusion, temperature and breathing maneuver on airway gas exchange and on measurement of exhaled soluble gas are discussed. A method for estimating the impact of airway gas exchange on exhaled breath measurements is presented. We recommend that investigators should carefully control the inspired air conditions and type of exhalation maneuver used in a breath test. Additionally, care should be taken when interpreting breath tests from subjects with pulmonary disease.},

A previously published model of heat, water and soluble gas exchange in the airways was improved by incorporating anatomical data on the airway wall to better describe the bronchial circulation and expanding the model to include a time varying description of soluble gas concentration in the alveoli. Next, the model was validated using two experimental data sets from the literature: ͑1͒ ethanol expirograms and ͑2͒ the uptake of seven soluble gases. Then, the model simulated the excretion of ten soluble gases whose blood:air partition coefﬁcient (␭b:a), a measure of blood solubility, ranged over 5 orders of magnitude. We found that gases with ␭b:aϽ10 exchange almost solely in the alveoli and gases with ␭b:aϾ100 exchange almost exclusively in the airways. Gases with ␭b:a between 10 and 100 have signiﬁcant interaction with the airways and alveoli. These results suggest that the airways play a larger role in pulmonary gas exchange than previously assumed and may require a reevaluation of pulmonary tests that involve exhaled samples of gases with ␭b:aϾ10. © 2003 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

This study was intended to assess (a) the effects of recruitment maneuvers onto VOC proﬁles, (b) the correlations between electrical impedance tomography (EIT) data and VOC proﬁles and (c) the effects of recruitment onto distribution of ventilation. Eleven mechanically ventilated patients were investigated during lung recruitment after cardiac surgery. Continuous breath gas analysis by means of PTR-ToF-MS, EIT and blood gas analyses were performed simultaneously. More than 300 mass traces could be detected and monitored continuously by means of PTR-ToF-MS in every patient. Exhaled VOC concentrations varied with recruitment induced changes in minute ventilation and cardiac output. Ammonia exhalation depended on blood pH. The improvement in dorsal lung ventilation during recruitment ranged from 9\% to 110\%. Correlations between exhaled concentrations of acetone, isoprene, benzene sevoﬂurane and improvement in regional ventilation during recruitment were observed. Extent and quality of these correlations depended on physico-chemical properties of the VOCs. Combination of continuous real-time breath analysis and EIT revealed correlations between exhaled VOC concentrations and distribution of ventilation. This setup enabled immediate recognition of physiological and therapeutic effects in ICU patients. In a perspective, VOC analysis could be used for non-invasive control and optimization of ventilation strategies.},

However, varying oxygen concentrations in the sample matrix may inﬂuence results from VOC analysis by PTRToF-MS. Elevated oxygen concentrations are likely to occur in clinical settings, but also when respiratory masks or breathing apparatus are used (e.g. in scuba diving, aviation, ﬁreﬁghting). Oxygen concentration may vary between subjects or within the course of a measurement or study and thus bias results. We systematically assessed the effect of high O2 concentrations (up to 90\%) in the sample matrix on the results of PTR-MS analysis for a pattern of VOCs including aromatics, aldehydes and ketones in dry and humid samples. In vivo experiments in healthy volunteers and mechanically ventilated animals were done to test the effect under real-life conditions. H3O+ count signiﬁcantly decreased by more than 40\% when the amount of oxygen in the sample matrix was increased. Almost all investigated VOCs were signiﬁcantly effected by varying oxygen concentrations and differences in signal intensities of more than 50\% could be observed. The effect was generally more pronounced in dry samples but still signiﬁcant under humid conditions. A linear dependency of sensitivity on the oxygen concentration in the sample matrix was observed for a number of VOCs (e.g. aldehydes) possibly enabling a factor based correction. VOC intensities were also inﬂuenced under in vivo conditions, e.g. ethanol decreased up to 71\%. When PTR-MS analysis is carried out under oxygen supply, these issues need to be carefully considered.},

	abstract = {Humans produce exhaled breath particles (EBPs) during various breath activities, such as normal breathing, coughing, talking, and sneezing. Airborne transmission risk exists when EBPs have attached pathogens. Until recently, few investigations had evaluated the size and concentration distributions of EBPs from mechanically ventilated patients with different ventilation mode settings. This study thus broke new ground by not only evaluating the size concentration distributions of EBPs in mechanically ventilated patients, but also investigating the relationship between EBP level and positive expiratory end airway pressure (PEEP), tidal volume, and pneumonia. This investigation recruited mechanically ventilated patients, with and without pneumonia, aged 20 years old and above, from the respiratory intensive care unit of a medical center. Concentration distributions of EBPs from mechanically ventilated patients were analyzed with an optical particle analyzer. This study finds that EBP concentrations from mechanically ventilated patients during normal breathing were in the range 0.47–2,554.04 particles/breath (0.001–4.644 particles/mL). EBP concentrations did not differ significantly between the volume control and pressure control modes of the ventilation settings in the mechanically ventilated patients. The patient EBPs were sized below 5 mm, and 80\% of them ranged from 0.3 to 1.0 mm. The EBPs concentrations in patients with high PEEP (. 5 cmH2O) clearly exceeded those in patients with low PEEP (\# 5 cmH2O). Additionally, a significant negative association existed between pneumonia duration and EBPs concentration. However, tidal volume was not related to EBPs concentration.},

Many metabolomic experiments are designed to compare changes observed over time under two experimental conditions or groups (e.g. a control and drug-treated group) with the goal of identifying discriminatory metabolites or biomarkers that characterize each condition. A common study design consists of repeated measurements taken on each experimental unit thus producing time courses of all metabolites. We describe a statistical framework for estimating time-varying metabolic proﬁles and their within-group variability and for detecting between-group differences. Speciﬁcally, we propose (i) a smoothing splines mixed effects (SME) model that treats each longitudinal measurement as a smooth function of time and (ii) an associated functional test statistic. Statistical signiﬁcance is assessed by a non-parametric bootstrap procedure.},

	abstract = {Background: Metabolomics time-course experiments provide the opportunity to understand the changes to an organism by observing the evolution of metabolic profiles in response to internal or external stimuli. Along with other omic longitudinal profiling technologies, these techniques have great potential to uncover complex relations between variations across diverse omic variables and provide unique insights into the underlying biology of the system. However, many statistical methods currently used to analyse short time-series omic data are i) prone to overfitting, ii) do not fully take into account the experimental design or iii) do not make full use of the multivariate information intrinsic to the data or iv) are unable to uncover multiple associations between different omic data. The model we propose is an attempt to i) overcome overfitting by using a weakly informative Bayesian model, ii) capture experimental design conditions through a mixed-effects model, iii) model interdependencies between variables by augmenting the mixed-effects model with a conditional auto-regressive (CAR) component and iv) identify potential associations between heterogeneous omic variables by using a horseshoe prior.
Results: We assess the performance of our model on synthetic and real datasets and show that it can outperform comparable models for metabolomic longitudinal data analysis. In addition, our proposed method provides the analyst with new insights on the data as it is able to identify metabolic biomarkers related to treatment, infer perturbed pathways as a result of treatment and find significant associations with additional omic variables. We also show through simulation that our model is fairly robust against inaccuracies in metabolite assignments. On real data, we demonstrate that the number of profiled metabolites slightly affects the predictive ability of the model.
Conclusions: Our single model approach to longitudinal analysis of metabolomics data provides an approach simultaneously for integrative analysis and biomarker discovery. In addition, it lends better interpretation by allowing analysis at the pathway level. An accompanying R package for the model has been developed using the probabilistic programming language Stan. The package offers user-friendly functions for simulating data, fitting the model, assessing model fit and postprocessing the results. The main aim of the R package is to offer freely accessible resources for integrative longitudinal analysis for metabolomics scientists and various visualization functions easy-to-use for applied researchers to interpret results.},

	abstract = {Time course ‘omics’ experiments are becoming increasingly important to study systemwide dynamic regulation. Despite their high information content, analysis remains challenging. ‘Omics’ technologies capture quantitative measurements on tens of thousands of molecules. Therefore, in a time course ‘omics’ experiment molecules are measured for multiple subjects over multiple time points. This results in a large, high-dimensional dataset, which requires computationally efficient approaches for statistical analysis. Moreover, methods need to be able to handle missing values and various levels of noise. We present a novel, robust and powerful framework to analyze time course ‘omics’ data that consists of three stages: quality assessment and filtering, profile modelling, and analysis. The first step consists of removing molecules for which expression or abundance is highly variable over time. The second step models each molecular expression profile in a linear mixed model framework which takes into account subject-specific variability. The best model is selected through a serial model selection approach and results in dimension reduction of the time course data. The final step includes two types of analysis of the modelled trajectories, namely, clustering analysis to identify groups of correlated profiles over time, and differential expression analysis to identify profiles which differ over time and/or between treatment groups. Through simulation studies we demonstrate the high sensitivity and specificity of our approach for differential expression analysis. We then illustrate how our framework can bring novel insights on two time course ‘omics’ studies in breast cancer and kidney rejection. The methods are publicly available, implemented in the R CRAN package lmms.},

	abstract = {Proton transfer reaction time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS) represents an attractive tool for the real-time analysis of VOC proﬁles in human breath. Quantiﬁcation of breath VOCs by means of direct MS may be affected by the matrix, as human breath not only contains several hundred VOCs at the ppbV–pptV level, but is water saturated and contains percentage levels of CO2. Investigation of breath biomarkers in clinical studies requires quantitative and comparable results. We therefore systematically assessed the effect of humidity, CO2 and O2 on the results of PTR-MS analysis. We investigated more than 20 VOCs, including aldehydes, ketones, aromatic compounds and hydrocarbons with different sample humidity, CO2 and O2 content. The inﬂuence of data processing (e.g. normalization to the H3O+ ion count) was also addressed. An increase of the H3O+ count of about 20\% was observed when the humidity in the sample was increased to breath levels. Large differences regarding the measured VOC intensities were found between the dry and humid samples. Data normalization to the H3O+ or water-clusters could not fully compensate for the humidity-dependent effects. However, as the determination of most VOCs linearly depends on the humidity over the whole investigated range, factor-based correction seems possible. The effects of CO2 were more pronounced in the dry samples than in the humid samples but only had a minor inﬂuence on the results. The same was true for the inﬂuence of O2. For the reliable quantiﬁcation of VOCs in clinical studies and for the standardization of VOC research, well-adapted calibration standards are required for PTR-MS analysis.},

This testing problem is non-regular because the tested parameter is on the boundary of the parameter space. Size and power of the different tests are investigated in an extensive simulation study that covers a variety of important settings. These include testing for polynomial regression versus a general smooth alternative using penalized splines. Among the test procedures considered, three are based on the restricted likelihood ratio test statistic (RLRT), while six are different extensions of the linear model F-test to the linear mixed model. Four of the tests with unknown null distributions are based on a parametric bootstrap, the other tests rely on approximate or asymptotic distributions. The parametric bootstrap-based tests all have a similar performance. Tests based on approximate F-distributions are usually the least powerful among the tests under consideration. The chi-square mixture approximation for the RLRT is conﬁrmed to be conservative, with corresponding loss in power. A recently developed approximation to the distribution of the RLRT is identiﬁed as a rapid, powerful and reliable alternative to computationally intensive parametric bootstrap procedures. This novel method extends the exact distribution available for models with one random effect to models with several random effects.},

	abstract = {With the growing interest in the use of breath volatiles in the health sciences, the lack of standardization for the sampling and analysis of exhaled breath is becoming a major issue leading to an absence of conformity, reproducibility and reliability in spectrometric measurements. Through the creation of a worldwide ‘peppermint consortium’, the International Association of Breath Research has set up a task force to deal with this problem. Pharmacokinetic studies are proposed, and a realtime analytical technique that is being used is proton transfer reaction-time-of-ﬂight-mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS). This paper presents details on how the volatile compounds contained in a peppermint oil capsule, and hence on breath, appear in a PTR-ToF-MS. To aid that study, the key volatiles in the headspace of peppermint oil were ﬁrst identiﬁed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, notably: menthol, menthone, 1,8-cineole, menthofuran, limonene, α-pinene and β-pinene. A PTR-ToF-MS analysis of these compounds has been undertaken, divorced from the complexity of the peppermint oil matrix using ‘normal’ and ‘saturated’ humidity drift-tube conditions, with the latter used to mimic breath samples, and over a range of reduced electric ﬁelds. There are no characteristic product ions that can distinguish monoterpenes and 1,8-cineole, and hence, without pre-separation, a combined washout for these volatiles can only be provided. By operating the drift tube above about 130 Td, there are characteristic product ions for menthone, menthofuran and menthol, namely m/z 155.14 (protonated menthone), m/z 151.11 (protonated menthofuran), m/z 139.15 (loss of H2O from protonated menthol) and m/z 83.09 (a fragment ion, C6H1+1, from menthol). These have been used to monitor, with a high speciﬁcity, the temporal proﬁle of these three compounds in breath following the ingestion of a peppermint oil capsule. To aid in the analyses, the proton afﬁnities and gas-phase basicities for the key volatiles investigated have been determined using density functional theory.},

	abstract = {High-throughput technologies such as transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics show great promise for the discovery of biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. Selection of the most promising candidates between the initial untargeted step and the subsequent validation phases is critical within the pipeline leading to clinical tests. Several statistical and data mining methods have been described for feature selection: in particular, wrapper approaches iteratively assess the performance of the classiﬁer on distinct subsets of variables. Current wrappers, however, do not estimate the signiﬁcance of the selected features. We therefore developed a new methodology to ﬁnd the smallest feature subset which signiﬁcantly contributes to the model performance, by using a combination of resampling, ranking of variable importance, signiﬁcance assessment by permutation of the feature values in the test subsets, and half-interval search. We wrapped our biosigner algorithm around three reference binary classiﬁers (Partial Least Squares—Discriminant Analysis, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines) which have been shown to achieve speciﬁc performances depending on the structure of the dataset. By using three real biological and clinical metabolomics and transcriptomics datasets (containing up to 7000 features), complementary signatures were obtained in a few minutes, generally providing higher prediction accuracies than the initial full model. Comparison with alternative feature selection approaches further indicated that our method provides signatures of restricted size and high stability. Finally, by using our methodology to seek metabolites discriminating type 1 from type 2 diabetic patients, several features were selected, including a fragment from the taurochenodeoxycholic bile acid. Our methodology, implemented in the biosigner R/Bioconductor package and Galaxy/Workﬂow4metabolomics module, should be of interest for both experimenters and statisticians to identify robust molecular signatures from large omics datasets in the process of developing new diagnostics.},

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efﬁciently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

E-nose devices are ideal instruments for measuring and monitoring carbon and greenhouse-gas emissions due to their sensitivity to a wide diversity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). A large number of e-nose instrument types, based on a wide diversity of technologies and operational mechanisms, are available to monitor gaseous and particulate pollutants released into the atmosphere, or liquid and dissolved organic pollutants released into municipal and industrial waste-water systems. Some commonly used e-nose technologies include conducting polymers (CP), metal-oxide semiconductor (MOS), quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), and surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensors. Potential pollution-detection applications of e-noses range from atmospheric pollutant (gas-leak) detection of carbon emissions from biofuel production plants and fossil-fuel production sources in the oil and gas industry to VOC-releases from numerous other industries. E-nose technologies are potentially capable of monitoring all phases of industrial manufacturing processes to minimize production of pollutants and maintain efficient, clean production lines. E-nose devices are also useful in designing more environmentallyfriendly, clean technologies for energy production, various industrial processes and product-manufacturing systems. This paper is a review of recent novel electronic-nose systems and algorithms, developed over the past decade, that have potential applications for detecting specific types of harmful VOC pollutants in the environment to meet carbon-capture and emission-reduction targets of worldwide environmental protection agencies.},

Breath samples were collected from 44 volunteers containing 14 females and 30 males. Urine samples were also collected to measure Creatinine Level (CL) by UV–vis Spectrophotometry as reference method. GC/Q-TOF-MS was used to identify volatile organic compounds that were detected in the exhaled breath of CKD, DM, and healthy subjects at different CL concentrations. The e-nose dataset was treated with Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Partial Least Squares-regression (PLSregression). PLS model revealed a relationship between breath and urinary CL. The presented results show that e-nose based on chemical gas sensors in combination with pattern recognition methods could constitute the basis of inexpensive and non-invasive diagnosis to distinguish between breath of CKD, DM patients and healthy controls based on breath VOC’s analysis.},

In many of these applications a compression step is necessary with the inevitable loss of quality information, for the sake of saving a little more bandwidth or storage space. While doing compression, we generally discard some pixels or frame during encoding and even upon decoding/decompression the exact data is not regenerated therefore the final image is not exactly the same as the original image. Thus to incorporate the compression losses, reconstruction using interpolation technique have been applied on the compressed image such that this can predict the discarded pixels or the missing pixels from the image. The proposed algorithm uses cubic B-Spline interpolation technique for reconstruction, exhibits significant improvement in reconstructed image quality.},

	abstract = {Splines, which were invented by Schoenberg more than fifty years ago, constitute an elegant framework for dealing with interpolation and discretization problems. They are widely used in computer-aided design and computer graphics, but have been neglected in medical imaging applications, mostly as a consequence of what one may call the "bad press" phenomenon. Thanks to some recent research efforts in signal processing and wavelet-related techniques, the virtues of splines have been revived in our community. There is now compelling evidence (several independent studies) that splines offer the best cost-performance tradeoff among available interpolation methods. In this presentation, we will argue that the spline representation is ideally suited for all processing tasks that require a continuous model of signals or images. We will show that most forms of spline fitting (interpolation, least squares approximation, smoothing splines) can be performed most efficiently using recursive digital filters. We will also have a look at their multiresolution properties which make them prime candidates for constructing wavelet bases and computing image pyramids. Typical application areas where these techniques can be useful are: image reconstruction from projection data, sampling grid conversion, geometric correction, visualization, rigid or elastic image registration, and feature extraction including edge detection and active contour models.},

	abstract = {It is well recognized that physiological and environmental factors such as race, age, gender, and diurnal cycles often have a definite influence on metabolic results that statistically manifests as confounding variables. Currently, removal or controlling of confounding effects relies heavily on experimental design. There are no available data processing techniques focusing on the compensation of their effects. We therefore proposed a new method, Metabolic confounding effect elimination (MCEE), to remove the influence of specified confounding factors and make the data more accurate. The method consists of three steps: metabolites grouping, confounder-related metabolites selection, and metabolites modification. Its effectiveness and advantages were evaluated comprehensively by several simulated models and real datasets, and were compared with two typical methods, the principal component analysis (PCA)- and the direct orthogonal signal correction (DOSC)-based methods. MCEE is simple, effective, and safe, and is independent of sample number, association degree, and missing value. Hence, it may serve as a good complement to existing metabolomics data preprocessing methods and aid in better understanding the metabolic and biological status of interest.},

Such procedures, however, are quite fallible. We examine several errors that often follow the use of statistical adjustment. The first is inferring a factor is causal because it predicts an outcome even after “statistical control” for other factors. This inference is fallacious when (as usual) such control involves removing the linear contribution of imperfectly measured variables, or when some confounders remain unmeasured. The converse fallacy is inferring a factor is not causally important because its association with the outcome is attenuated or eliminated by the inclusion of covariates in the adjustment process. This attenuation may only reflect that the covariates treated as confounders are actually mediators (intermediates) and critical to the causal chain from the study factor to the study outcome. Other problems arise due to mismeasurement of the study factor or outcome, or because these study variables are only proxies for underlying constructs. Statistical adjustment serves a useful function, but it cannot transform observational studies into natural experiments, and involves far more subjective judgment than many users realize. Key words: confounds, risk factors, statistical control, mediators, covariates.},

	abstract = {On-line analysis of exhaled breath oﬀers insight into a person’s metabolism without the need for sample preparation or sample collection. Due to its noninvasive nature and the possibility to sample continuously, the analysis of breath has great clinical potential. The unique features of this technology make it an attractive candidate for applications in medicine, beyond the task of diagnosis. We review the current methodologies for on-line breath analysis, discuss current and future applications, and critically evaluate challenges and pitfalls such as the need for standardization. Special emphasis is given to the use of the technology in diagnosing respiratory diseases, potential niche applications, and the promise of breath analysis for personalized medicine. The analytical methodologies used range from very small and low-cost chemical sensors, which are ideal for continuous monitoring of disease status, to optical spectroscopy and state-of-the-art, high-resolution mass spectrometry. The latter can be utilized for untargeted analysis of exhaled breath, with the capability to identify hitherto unknown molecules. The interpretation of the resulting big data sets is complex and often constrained due to a limited number of participants. Even larger data sets will be needed for assessing reproducibility and for validation of biomarker candidates. In addition, molecular structures and quantiﬁcation of compounds are generally not easily available from on-line measurements and require complementary measurements, for example, a separation method coupled to mass spectrometry. Furthermore, a lack of standardization still hampers the application of the technique to screen larger cohorts of patients. This review summarizes the present status and continuous improvements of the principal on-line breath analysis methods and evaluates obstacles for their wider application.},

The potential importance of these clinical applications has made the development of better methods for processing and analyzing the data an active area of research. It is, however, difﬁcult to determine which methods are better without knowing the true biochemical composition of the samples used in the experiments.
Methods: We developed a mathematical model based on the physics of a simple MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer with time-lag focusing. Using this model, we implemented a statistical simulation of mass spectra. We used the simulation to explore some of the basicoperating characteristics of MALDI or SELDI instruments.
Results: The simulation reproduced several characteristics of actual instruments. We found that the relative mass error is affected bythe time discretization of the detector (about 0.01\%) and the spread of initial velocities (about 0.1\%). The accuracy of calibration based on external standards decays rapidly outside the range spanned by the calibrants. Natural isotope distributions play a major role inbroadening peaks associated with individual proteins. The area of a peak is a more accurate measure of its size than the height.
Conclusions: The model described here is capable of simulating realistic mass spectra. The simulation should become a useful tool forgenerating spectra where the true inputs are known, allowing researchers to evaluate the performance of new methods for processing and analyzing mass spectra.},

	abstract = {Many modern time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) instruments use fast analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) with high-speed digitizers to record mass spectra with extended dynamic range (compared to time-to-digital conversion). The extended dynamic range oﬀered by ADC detection is critical for accurate measurement of transient events. However, the use of ADC also increases the variance of the measurements by sampling the gain statistics of electron multipliers (EMs) used for detection. The inﬂuence of gain statistics on the shape of TOF signal distributions is especially pronounced at low count rates and is a major contributor to measurement variance. Here, we use Monte Carlo methods to simulate low-ion-count TOFMS signals as a function of Poisson statistics and the measured pulse-height distribution (PHD) of the EM detection system. We ﬁnd that a compound Poisson distribution calculated via Monte Carlo simulation eﬀectively describes the shape of measured TOFMS signals. Additionally, we apply Monte Carlo simulation results to single-particle inductively coupled plasma (sp-ICP) TOFMS analysis. We demonstrate that subtraction of modeled TOFMS signals can be used to quantitatively uncover particle-signal distributions buried beneath dissolved-signal backgrounds. On the basis of simulated signal distributions, we also calculate new critical values (LC) that are used as decision thresholds for the detection of discrete particles. This new detection criterion better accounts for the shape of dissolved signal distributions and therefore provides more robust identiﬁcation of single particles with ICPTOFMS.},

	abstract = {Background: Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a ubiquitous analytical tool in biological research and is used to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of bio-molecules. Peak detection is the essential first step in MS data analysis. Precise estimation of peak parameters such as peak summit location and peak area are critical to identify underlying biomolecules and to estimate their abundances accurately. We propose a new method to detect and quantify peaks in mass spectra. It uses dual-tree complex wavelet transformation along with Stein’s unbiased risk estimator for spectra smoothing. Then, a new method, based on the modified Asymmetric Pseudo-Voigt (mAPV) model and hierarchical particle swarm optimization, is used for peak parameter estimation.
Results: Using simulated data, we demonstrated the benefit of using the mAPV model over Gaussian, Lorentz and Bi-Gaussian functions for MS peak modelling. The proposed mAPV model achieved the best fitting accuracy for asymmetric peaks, with lower percentage errors in peak summit location estimation, which were 0.17\% to 4.46\% less than that of the other models. It also outperformed the other models in peak area estimation, delivering lower percentage errors, which were about 0.7\% less than its closest competitor - the Bi-Gaussian model. In addition, using data generated from a MALDI-TOF computer model, we showed that the proposed overall algorithm outperformed the existing methods mainly in terms of sensitivity. It achieved a sensitivity of 85\%, compared to 77\% and 71\% of the two benchmark algorithms, continuous wavelet transformation based method and Cromwell respectively.
Conclusions: The proposed algorithm is particularly useful for peak detection and parameter estimation in MS data with overlapping peak distributions and asymmetric peaks. The algorithm is implemented using MATLAB and the source code is freely available at http://mapv.sourceforge.net.},

	abstract = {Background: Mass Spectrometry coupled to Liquid Chromatography (LC-MS) is commonly used to analyze the protein content of biological samples in large scale studies. The data resulting from an LC-MS experiment is huge, highly complex and noisy. Accordingly, it has sparked new developments in Bioinformatics, especially in the fields of algorithm development, statistics and software engineering. In a quantitative label-free mass spectrometry experiment, crucial steps are the detection of peptide features in the mass spectra and the alignment of samples by correcting for shifts in retention time. At the moment, it is difficult to compare the plethora of algorithms for these tasks. So far, curated benchmark data exists only for peptide identification algorithms but no data that represents a ground truth for the evaluation of feature detection, alignment and filtering algorithms.
Results: We present LC-MSsim, a simulation software for LC-ESI-MS experiments. It simulates ESI spectra on the MS level. It reads a list of proteins from a FASTA file and digests the protein mixture using a user-defined enzyme. The software creates an LC-MS data set using a predictor for the retention time of the peptides and a model for peak shapes and elution profiles of the mass spectral peaks. Our software also offers the possibility to add contaminants, to change the background noise level and includes a model for the detectability of peptides in mass spectra. After the simulation, LC-MSsim writes the simulated data to mzData, a public XML format. The software also stores the positions (monoisotopic m/z and retention time) and ion counts of the simulated ions in separate files.
Conclusion: LC-MSsim generates simulated LC-MS data sets and incorporates models for peak shapes and contaminations. Algorithm developers can match the results of feature detection and alignment algorithms against the simulated ion lists and meaningful error rates can be computed. We anticipate that LC-MSsim will be useful to the wider community to perform benchmark studies and comparisons between computational tools.},

The identiﬁcation of a protein is the critical ﬁrst step in elucidating its biological function. Successful protein identiﬁcation depends on various interrelated factors, including effective analysis of MS data generated in a proteomic experiment. This analysis comprises several stages, often combined in a pipeline or workﬂow. The ﬁrst component of the analysis is known as spectra pre-processing. In this component, the raw data generated by the mass spectrometer is processed to eliminate noise and identify the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and intensity for the peaks in the spectrum corresponding to the presence of certain peptides or peptide fragments. Since all downstream analyses depend on the pre-processed data, effective pre-processing is critical to protein identiﬁcation and characterization. There is a critical need for more robust preprocessing algorithms that perform well on tandem mass spectra under a variety of different conditions and can be easily integrated into sophisticated data analysis pipelines for practical wet-lab applications.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and combined with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/ MS) have become a prominent tool for the analysis of complex proteomic samples. An important step in a typical workflow is the combination of results from multiple LC-MS experiments to improve confidence in the obtained measurements or to compare results from different samples. To do so, a suitable mapping or alignment between the data sets needs to be estimated. The alignment has to correct for variations in mass and elution time which are present in all mass spectrometry experiments.},

	abstract = {Almost exclusively, lineshape functions used to model infrared (IR) absorption peaks are based on symmetric frequency distributions. However, in complex systems such as large biological macromolecules in aqueous solutions, the distribution of vibrational frequencies may in fact be asymmetric. In this communication, we show that asymmetry can be introduced to the standard symmetric Lorentzian and Gaussian lineshapes using a simple, easy to implement method. Our technique involves replacing the static width parameter of the symmetric proﬁles with a smoothly varying function that is wave number dependent. In this way, the width varies across the IR band resulting in an asymmetric peak. In our model, the width varies sigmoidally with wave number. As a demonstration, we ﬁt experimental spectra of adenosine 50-monophosphate (AMP).},
