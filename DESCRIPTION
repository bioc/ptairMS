Description: This package implements a suite of methods to preprocess data from PTR-TOF-MS instruments (HDF5 format) and 
   generates the 'sample by features' table of peak intensities in addition to the sample and feature metadata (as a single ExpressionSet object for subsequent statistical analysis). The steps include control quality, calibration, peak detection and quantification,feature alignment, missing value imputation and feature annotation. Applications to exhaled air and headspace are described in the vignettes.
